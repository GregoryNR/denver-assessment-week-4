Notes to discern WTF I'm really trying to do here and
understand what I think this test is "testing" or trying to do.do
  ?What is h1? No idea what this is. Is it Heading1?

I think there may need to be a puts to ask user to type in a
string that is converted into an array and then we run tests
on it, but I'm not certain.

1. Create a method that returns the total number of dogs
in the hash. AND make it so the H1 (header) reads "There are 4 dogs"
2. Create a method that returns the total number of dogs
in the hash. AND make it so the H1 (header) reads "There are 4 dogs"

#create user input as an array of hashes.
words=dogs_name.split

name = hash.new(0)
